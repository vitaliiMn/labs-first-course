In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.

the function grows near 0. Also, in the page \pageref{fig:mesh1} 
is the same example.

The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation

\[E=mc^2\]

discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 
In natural units ($c$ = 1), the formula expresses the identity

\begin{equation}
E=m
\end{equation}
